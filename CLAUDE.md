# weft-site template

This is the Astro template every weft site is scaffolded from.

## Editing rules (when AI is editing this site)

For 95% of changes, edit ONLY `src/data/main.json`. That file is the canonical content surface.

Touch other files only when the user explicitly asks for structural/visual changes that the schema can't express (e.g. "add a custom contact form component" — that needs a new `.astro` file).

## Schema (src/data/main.json — the canonical content file)

```json
{
  "site":   { "name", "tagline", "description", "url"? },
  "pages":  [ { "slug", "title", "content" (markdown) } ],
  "theme":  { "accent" (#hex), "mode" ("light"|"dark"|"auto"), "font" ("sans"|"serif"|"mono") },
  "design"?: {
    "aesthetic": string,
    "fonts":   { "display": { "family", "import" (Google Fonts URL) }, "body": { "family", "import" } },
    "palette": { "light": { "bg","fg","accent","muted","border" }, "dark"?: { ... } },
    "css":     string  // custom global CSS, injected last; plain CSS only (no <style> tags)
  },
  "schema": { "type" (Schema.org type), "extra"? (object) }
}
```

- `design` is OPTIONAL. When present it drives real fonts, palette, and custom CSS
  (validated/sanitized by `src/design.ts` at build time). When absent, the site renders
  via the legacy `theme` look. **Do not add a `design` block to a site that lacks one
  unless the user explicitly asks for a redesign/new look** — edit `theme` for small
  tweaks. When a `design` block already exists, edit it (fonts/palette/css) for visual
  changes; keep `css` plain (no `<style>` tags).

- `pages[0]` MUST have `slug: "/"` (it's the home page).
- Every other page's slug MUST start with `/` and contain only `[a-z0-9-/]`.
- `content` is rendered as Markdown via `marked`. Headings, lists, links, emphasis, code all work.
- `theme.accent` is the single brand color, surfaced as `--accent` everywhere.
- `schema.type` controls the JSON-LD `@type` emitted in the page head.

## File map

```
src/
  data/main.json           # the contract — edit this
  site.ts                  # typed wrapper around main.json
  layouts/Base.astro       # HTML shell, head, JSON-LD, OG, theme CSS variables
  pages/
    index.astro            # renders pages[slug=="/"]
    [...slug].astro        # renders any non-home page
    llms.txt.ts            # /llms.txt
    api/site.json.ts       # /api/site.json (machine-readable mirror)
public/
  robots.txt               # allow all + sitemap pointer
  media/                   # uploaded images live here
```

## What's already AI-optimized

- Schema.org JSON-LD per page (driven by `schema.type` + page content)
- Open Graph + Twitter card tags
- `/llms.txt` advertising the canonical pages and `/api/site.json`
- `/api/site.json` returning the full content config as JSON
- Sitemap (via `@astrojs/sitemap`) at `/sitemap-index.xml`
- robots.txt allowing all + pointing at sitemap
- Semantic HTML5 throughout

## Don't

- Don't add a JS framework (React, Vue, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks. Astro islands stay zero-JS by default.
- Don't introduce a CSS framework (Tailwind, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks. The vanilla CSS-vars approach keeps the LLM's editing surface tight.
- Don't invent facts. If the brief or instruction doesn't supply a fact, leave a `[placeholder]` and note it.
